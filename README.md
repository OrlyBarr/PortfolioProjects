# Nashville Housing Data for Data Cleaning
In this project, I explored and cleaned the Nashville Housing Data by the following steps:
*	**Data Shape-** Looking at how many columns and rows the data have.  
*	**Columns Name-** Understanding the meaning of each column
*	**Null Value-** Handling Null values
*	**Date Format-** Standardize Date Format
*	**Filtering and Sorting-** Filtering the columns and checking that the values of each column are correct and coherent.
*	**Duplicate Values-** Remove duplicate values
*	**Unused Columns-** Delete unused columns

**Important Remark**-
When we do Cleaning in the database, we have to not do the cleaning on the raw data.
We should do a backup database.
